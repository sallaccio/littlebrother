Little Brother is watching you but only when you tell him to: minimal task timer from Windows7 notification bar.

------
Select a single task at a time, from a simple menu accessible from the Notification Area on right-click:

</p>

It's simple to add, remove a project. And also to pause it for a given amount of time:

  &emsp;&emsp;

  &emsp;&emsp;

</p>

The real downside of it all is... well, that the output is pretty ugly. If you choose __TimeSheet__ in the menu, you get this:

</p>

There's definitely some work that can be done there.
